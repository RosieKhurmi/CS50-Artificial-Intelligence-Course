# CS50-Artificial-Intelligence-Course

This is all of the code I have written while learning from the Harvard CS50â€™s Artificial Intelligence with Python course. 

These are projects provided in the course on topis such as search, knowledge, uncertainity, optimization, learning, neural networks and language.
